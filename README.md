# Solutions For Problems in Codility

STEPS TO EXECUTE:

Prerequistes:

    -- As i solved the solutions in typescript - Node, NPM, Typescript latest versions should be installed
    -- IDE used: Vscode

1) Clone the repository
2) Execute the command "npm install" in terminal to install types modules
3) Compile the ts files to create js files(already created in repository) using command "tsc filename.ts"
4) Execute the js file using command "node {filename}.js"
5) For most of the problems retrieving inputs and displaying the outputs are excluded, rather the method with logic alone has been added
